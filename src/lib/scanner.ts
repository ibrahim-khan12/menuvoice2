// Guided menu scanner — auto-shutter with real image analysis and actionable
// audio coaching for blind users. Replaces the old autocapture.ts.
//
// Per-frame metrics (160x120 grayscale, ~6fps, main thread — cheap at this size):
//   - luminance      mean brightness (too dark?)
//   - glareFrac      fraction of blown-out pixels (glare/reflection — a mean
//                    brightness check misses glare on an otherwise dim photo)
//   - sharpness      Laplacian variance (blur — from the earlier scanner prototype)
//   - edgeDensity    how much text-like detail is in frame (is a menu there?)
//   - centroid       where the detail is (directional "move the menu left" hints)
//   - motion         inter-frame difference (steadiness)
//
// Coaching strategy:
//   - Each problem state has 2 escalating messages with a concrete fix; after
//     the second, silence until the state changes (no nagging).
//   - Steadying: spoken 3-2-1 countdown + rising earcon ticks, then capture.
//   - BEST-SHOT FALLBACK: if lighting + content are fine but perfect steadiness
//     never arrives, capture anyway after ~5s. The vision model tolerates a
//     slightly soft photo far better than a frustrated user tolerates waiting.
//   - GUARANTEED CAPTURE: every quality gate relaxes as time passes (see the
//     patience block below), so a problem the user cannot see and cannot fix
//     — glare, a page bigger than the frame, a tilt they cannot feel — can no
//     longer stop the shutter forever. Anything readable is photographed by
//     ~7s and, at the outside, ~11s. The only frames still refused are ones
//     with nothing on them and ones smeared mid-swing.
//   - onStruggle now only OFFERS manual, when nothing readable has been in
//     frame at all. It never switches auto capture off.
//   - Every state change is reported via onState for telemetry.

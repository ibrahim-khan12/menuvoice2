// End-to-end cover for the MenuScanner STATE MACHINE (not just its pure
// metrics): does auto-capture actually fire, in both phone orientations, and
// does the "turn the phone" advice stay advisory instead of blocking a shot?
//
// The pure-function tests next door verify the measurements. This file verifies
// the loop that acts on them, which is where a wide menu in a portrait frame
// could silently stall — the case a blind tester reported from a restaurant.
//
// Only the two DOM calls the scanner makes are stubbed (canvas + video
// dimensions); the scanner's own logic runs unmodified. Ticks are driven
// manually so the test is deterministic and does not wait on real timers.
